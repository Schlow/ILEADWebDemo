  author: Aziz Ansari
  rating: 4
  review: "As a Parks and Recreation fan, I must admit that I'm particularly vulnerable to Aziz Ansari's specific brand of adorable, and that's what initially drew me to Modern Romance. That said, this non-fiction non-enthusiast enjoyed listening to the audiobook. Ansari injects the facts, figures, and focus group testimonies with his personality in a way that kept me entertained throughout. The complexities of today's dating world, which Ansari and his sources bring to light in approachable and interesting ways, inspired fun side conversations between myself and my husband. Well worth your time!" - Katie

  review: "I devoured this book - it was delicious! Mystery, romance, history and a glimpse into culinary publishing and an iconic cheese shop combined with letters written by a 12 year old to the famous chef, James Beard, and a puzzle/treasure hunt kept my interest even though I'm not a foodie. Written by a well known food writer and chef." - Cindy

  review: "Fans of both Science Fiction and Fantasy will enjoy The Vagrant. In this technological future, littered with skeletons of battleships, invaded by demons, and demonic infused half-humans, people pray for the return of the angelic Seraph Knights, who have not been seen since the death of Gamma, one of The Seven. A man called the Vagrant travels with a small baby, a goat, and a holy sword. Never uttering a word, he journeys to the Shining City to return the holy sword to the Seven, helping the half-humans and refugees that scatter the land. Slowly, a band of followers will gather around him as he seeks to fulfill his quest. An impressive and unusual tale filled with compelling characters, Peter Neman's debut novel pulls the reader in with impressively immersive world building," - Michael

- title: In Defense of a Liberal Education
  author: Fareed Zakaria
  rating: 3
  review: "Zakaria brings forward a spirited defense of the liberal education in this short but wide-ranging book. Not only does he discuss the value that a liberal education provides, but he also brings in the history of U.S. education and how it contrasts with other parts of the world. Certainly much of his defense of liberal education is viewed through the lens of its usefulness for jobs and corporations, but for anyone who regularly reads or watches Fareed Zakaria, this won't come as a surprise--foreign policy and related questions of economies are his strong suite. This book is well worth the time spent reading it, and those in my age range will appreciate his defense of millennials against the current, and incorrect, conventional wisdom at the end of the work," - Brady
